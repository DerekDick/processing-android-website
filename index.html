            Processing for Android is a mode for the Processing environment that has as primary goal to 
            simplify the development of Android apps using the Processing language. Using this mode, you can 
            run Processing sketches on Android devices with little or no modification, and you are also able 
            to the use the Android SDK for advanced functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
            You don't need to worry about the complexities of installing the Android SDK, creating project folders, 
            or specifying default assets. All you need to do is to write your sketch as you would normally do when 
            coding for desktop, and then simply run it on your Android device or the emulator. You can also export 
            your sketch as a signed package ready to upload to Google Play market.
            </p>

            <p>
            The current version of the mode (3.0) allows you to create regular Android apps. The upcoming 4.0 version 
            will incorporate support for live wallpapers, watch faces, and Cardboard. Stay tuned for updates from the 
            Contribution Manager in the PDE, or the Processing twitter channel!
