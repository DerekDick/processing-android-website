                The Processing for Android project is an effort within the Processing community to bring up-to-date support for Android development into the Processing environment. The main component of this project is the <em>Android Mode</em>, a <a href="https://processing.org/reference/environment/#Programming_modes">programming mode</a> for the Processing Development Environment (PDE) that allows you to create Android apps using the Processing language. With this mode, you can run Processing sketches in Android devices with little or no changes in the code, while also being able to access the Android SDK for advanced functionality (sensors, geolocation, etc.)
                </p>

                <p>
                The mode takes care of repetitive tasks such as installing the SDK files, creating project folders, and setting default assets. All you need to do is to write your sketch as you would normally do when working in the Java mode, and then simply run it on your Android device or the emulator. You can also export your sketch as a signed package to upload to the Google Play Store.
                </p>

                <p>
                The current version of the mode (3.0) allows you to create regular Android apps. The upcoming 4.0 version, currently in beta stage, adds support for <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/02/live-wallpapers.html">live wallpapers</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/index.html">watch faces</a>, and <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/index.html">Google Cardboard</a>. Stay tuned for updates from the Contribution Manager in the PDE, or the Processing twitter channel!  
                </p>

               Work on the Android mode started in 2010 with Ben Fry and Jonathan Feinberg implementing the basic pieces, and Andres Colubri developing the GLES renderer. During Google Summer of Code 2014 and 2015, Imil Ziyaztdinov and Umair Khan, respectively, added important features into the mode (automatic SDK download, export signed apps). In 2016, with support from Google Creative Lab, Andres Colubri extended the mode to support wallpapers, watch faces, and Cardboard.
