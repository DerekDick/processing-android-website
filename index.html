                Processing for Android is a mode for the Processing environment that has as primary goal to 
                simplify the development of Android apps using the Processing language. Using this mode, you can 
                run Processing sketches on Android devices with little or no modification, and you are also able 
                to the use the Android SDK for advanced functionality.
                </p>

                <p>
                You don't need to worry about the complexities of installing the Android SDK, creating project folders, 
                or specifying default assets. All you need to do is to write your sketch as you would normally do when 
                coding for desktop, and then simply run it on your Android device or the emulator. You can also export 
                your sketch as a signed package ready to upload to Google Play market.
                </p>

                <p>
                The current version of the mode (3.0) allows you to create regular Android apps. The upcoming 4.0 version 
                will incorporate support for live wallpapers, watch faces, and Cardboard. Stay tuned for updates from the 
                Contribution Manager in the PDE, or the Processing twitter channel!
